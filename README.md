In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, laptops have become indispensable tools for work, education, and entertainment. The wide variety of laptops available in the market, each boasting unique specifications and features, has made the task of determining their prices a complex challenge.using the Python programming language, this is a machine learning model for forecasting laptop pricing.This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive foundation for predicting laptop prices based on various attributes.By amalgamating data from diverse sources,such as size, display, RAM, memory, chipset, GPU, and operating system.
The primary goal of this research is to forecast the price of laptop computers using multiple Machine Learning (ML) models. This allows customers to make judgements based on several inputs or criteria, such as
The primary goal of this research is to forecast the price of  laptop computers using multiple Machine Learning (ML) models. This allows customers to make judgements based on several inputs or criteria, such as
●	Brand Name
●	Laptop Type
●	Laptop Size (in inches)
●	Screen Resolution
●	Cpu 
●	RAM
●	Memory
●	GPU
●	Operating System
●	Weight
The project uses Linear Regression technique of Supervised learning to predict the sales of a particular laptop.
